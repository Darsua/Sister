# VM Network Simulation Configurations

This directory contains configuration files for each virtual machine (VM) used in the network simulation.  
Each subdirectory represents a different VM, such as the client, the DNS/DHCP server, the reverse proxy, and the web server.  
The files include network interface settings, service configurations, firewall rules, and supporting scripts.
